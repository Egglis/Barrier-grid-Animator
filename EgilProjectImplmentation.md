### Running the code
The project was implmented with python3. The GUI was implmented using tkinter [[1]](#1) while the image manipulation was done using the Pillow library [[2]](#2). The project can be ran using any IDE by running <code>main.py</code>. The repository contains a <code>ExampleGifs</code> folder which contains example gifs that can be used to test the program.The program currently only supports gifs, but can be easily extended to support other image/video formats.


The program can also be ran from the command line by running <code>python3 main.py</code> in the root directory of the project.
