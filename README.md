# Barrier-grid-Animator
The goal of this project is to create a tool that can be used to generate barrier-grid animations. It is  an optical illusion that is interpreted by the human visual system as animation.


### /ExampleGifs includes some example gifs with varying amounts of success

# Compile
Should be able to run with any Python compiler, UI is made using Tkinter and images are generated using PIL 

# Findings
* It is not that good from any gif/video/animation with more frames than 6.
* I have implmented a frame reduction method, which redcued the amount of frames for longer videos 
* 6 frames of animation is not a lot, at that point why not show steps?
* Other grids was attempted, however i did not find any thing that works 

# Packages
